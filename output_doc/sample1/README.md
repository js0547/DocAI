## Summary for `math_add.py`

 **High-Level Summary:**
This Python module, `math_tools.py`, provides a simple mathematical utility function for addition of two numbers.

**Important Functions with Brief Explanations:**
1. `def add(a, b):` - This function takes in two numerical arguments and returns their sum. The purpose is to provide an easy way to perform basic addition operations.

**Running the Program:**
If this module is intended to be used as a library in other scripts, it doesn't have a main function or entry point to run directly. To use the `add` function from another script, you would import it like so:

```python
from utils.math_tools import add

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

If instead, you'd like to test the `add` function locally within this script, you can create a separate script and call the function from there. For example:

```python
from math_tools import add

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Outputs: 8
```

## Summary for `main.py`

 **High-Level Summary:**
This Python script, named `main.py`, is a simple program that performs addition of two numbers using the `math_add` module's `add` function and prints the result. It demonstrates basic usage of external modules in Python.

**Important Functions/Classes:**
1. `add(a, b)`: This function is defined in the `math_add` module. It takes two arguments (numbers `a` and `b`) and returns their sum. In this script, it is used to calculate the result of adding 5 and 3.

**Running the Program:**
To run this program, simply execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python main.py
```

This will execute the `main()` function, perform the addition operation, print the result, and exit the script.
